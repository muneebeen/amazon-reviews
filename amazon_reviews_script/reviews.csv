Maxwell,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It looks pretty, but the space bar is trash.",I purchased this keyboard for my at home office setup. I have an older 4+ year old mechanical keyboard that I took back to my office now that work from home has ended for me. Would that I could have purchased a second of that 4+ year old mechanical keyboard. It worked like a charm. This one just does not.,B08MWP6CK4
James,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent for the price with one annoying feature,"It's my first mechanical keyboard and I'm generally happy with it, especially for the price as compared to more expensive ones. But it does have a tendency to double-tap letters sometimes, requiring me to go back and delete the duplicate letter. This doesn't happen often enough to significantly impair the usefulness of the keyboard, but it's annoying when it does happen.",B08MWP6CK4
Pen Name,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great deal!,A little disappointed in how loud the buttons are but other than that I'm happy,B08MWP6CK4
Shyanne Baker,3.0 out of 5 stars,Am i the only one having this issue?,I do enjoy this- ive noticed certain keys will just randomly not work. I play a decent amount of games that use W A S D and QWER and ive noticed some times i cant press them rapidly and sometimes they will not work or register that they are being pressed. Other than that i like it,B08MWP6CK4

Fox Mulder,2.0 out of 5 stars,lasted 7 months,"purchased in July 2021. easy setup just plug and play. looks nice and seems well made, however it is now Feb 2022 and some of the keys are not working correctly. Space bar is page down and so are a few of the letter keys. Will look for another brand for replacement since return window has passed.",B08MWP6CK4
AC,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice,"Very nice, first mechanical keyboard. Very loud clicky clack key noise. Wife thought I was using a type writer!",B08MWP6CK4

Lisa Sorenson,1.0 out of 5 stars,Keyboard was shipped with no packing or foam. I should have sent it back.,Keys sticking,B08MWP6CK4
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible keyboard - do not buy,"Just a few weeks after I got it, the space bar started working only like half the time. now the E key has stopped working almost completely as well. People buy a mechanical keyboard to avoid these types of issues, and this keyboard has been nothing but trouble.",B08MWP6CK4
Lizanne Michael,4.0 out of 5 stars,Game mouse using for office work,"I really like this gaming mouse because of the colors it’s got like a really cool set of colors that it changes to. I also like that it’s not like a plastic tail. It’s a little difficult to handle, it’s kind of slow, but I guess that’s what you get with this gaming mouse. I do use it for work and it’s fine. I intentionally purchased it to use for work.",B08615TQ9C
Phaser,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice, but heavy","Overall a great product. The only reason why I'm giving it four stars instead of five is the weight. As a gamer, this mouse was more bulky and heavier than I originally thought it would be. The main thing about the product is also the lighting. It's cool and all, but I would prefer it so I can change the color to what I want without it being a specific DPI. If you're using this as an everyday mouse, great purchase. If you're using this for gaming, it's still a great mouse. It's cheap, and actually nice. These are just my opinions, but I'm sure you'd love the mouse.",B08615TQ9C
D. Mathis,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fiodio Wired Gaming Mouse has great feel,Fiodio Wired Gaming Mouse I use mostly for laptop has good result for ergonomics and has a decent price.,B08615TQ9C
Casey Martinez,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for big hands,My thumb is always touching the extra 2 thumb buttons which doesn't feel good. If you have a large hand that could be an issue for long term use. Everything else is good.,B08615TQ9C
Aaron,4.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and Large; but not Silent,"Very comfortable for my hand and also has almost a minky-soft feel to the plastic. Programmable buttons work great, it's a very good size, and it cycles through colors nicely. Only problem is that it is about the same volume as a regular computer mouse click despite being advertised as silent; no problem for me though. Also you may have to uninstall and reinstall the device to avoid mouse lag when you first get it but it only takes a couple minutes and for a guide on win10 I used  ComputerSluggish Tutorial's video on it. Overall very good for price. Will update if something goes wrong.",B08615TQ9C
Skytan,4.0 out of 5 stars,ok,it's ok,B08615TQ9C
briana weekly,3.0 out of 5 stars,The scroll wheel…,It’s a good mouse for the money but the scroll wheel is recessed into the body and makes it hard to use.,B08615TQ9C
Lillian Vargas,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love the colors,"I love the colors on this mouse. It's very nice to look at. It's very responsive too, however, it's a little too large for the size of my hands. I have to stretch to reach the scrolling wheel.",B08615TQ9C
Gabriel Canuteson,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Slow, not Good for gaming.",The mouse is comfortable and can support a large hand but the response time is less than ideal and it feels very sluggish.,B08615TQ9C

Wilson,1.0 out of 5 stars,No serve después de un mes. Not working anymore., It stopped working after a month! Don’t buy.,
Aaron T.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not durable,Was great for a couple of months. Then the T key started stittttctktittngt.,
Karen,4.0 out of 5 stars,Gaming Keyboard,"A nice gaming keyboard, but not as comfortable for typing.",
J. Rose,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very clicky!,"I mostly wanted this keyboard because I adore the loud, clicky sound of mechanical keyboards. As a child of the 80s, I learned how to type on a wonderful, clunky Packard Bell keyboard and it was amazing. All the keyboards I've had since have been thin membrane-type keyboards, and there's no sensory feedback with those at all. I'm so happy that keyboards like this are available for people like me who do a lot of typing and like to make a lot of noise (and be able to really feel each key) while we do it.",
Aderyn,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a very satisfactory keyboard,"I am not a gamer, but my job requires me to use a keyboard almost nonstop, so I’m very picky about my keyboards.  I love having the clicky feedback, especially when I really get to rocking and rolling on the keys, so these blue switches are just right for me.  The keys engage with a very light touch, very kind to your fingers and hands, and the rollover function seems excellent; I have not managed to “out type” them yet, and I’m speedy.  I love the colorful backlighting, and it’s helpful since my workdays often stretch into the late night.  Keys can be lighted selectively, which seems as if it would be a nice advantage for gamers.  It has small retractable feet on the back edge so you can adjust the tilt to your preference.",
Victoria,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good mechanical keyboard for the price!,My son was excited to test this out and see how it compared to the more expensive one he currently has.,
Kristen B,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great after breaking in,"So at first I thought I had a dude, and I could still have as when the keyboard came it was loose in the box and not packaged well.  The keys didn't work well at the start, had to "" break"" them in.  After a month of use though the keys work great and love that it has a 10-key.",
Shaun H20,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice keyboard,"This is a nice keyboard that I'm using for my laptop in the other room.  It's not as loud and ""clicky"" as my very expensive Corsair but overall it takes very little time to get used to. Also, the RGB makes it look really nice although you have limited control of the lighting effects of course unlike the Corsair (which uses iCue and can give you all sorts of crazy effects for your keyboard).  I'd definitely recommend this keyboard, it's a good value.",
rareoopdvds,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Keys are loud, but works well for gaming","This is a really nice keyboard, both functionally and aesthetically. The LED color patterns really make it standout as something ""cool"". While the lights do show up in mult-colors and they have some pattern to their changing colors, there is no way to manipulate the pattern - so you just let it do what it does. The key are loud and make the clicking noises with every press of the key, and as they are high from being spring loaded, they can sometimes make normal typing challenging. Besides this, I really like this keyboard and was a good price for what you get.",
Zest,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good value,"I personally collect a numerous of mechanical keyboards, such as ""corsair K70"", ""ROCCAT Vulcan 120 AIMO"", ""Razer BlackWidow V3 Pro Mechanical Wireless Gaming Keyboard"" with ""Green Mechanical Switches"". I also tested and reviewed many Chinese made, cheaper mechanical keyboard from Anker, Ajazz(""Ajazz AK35I"") , etc. So I had good expectation of what a good mechanical keyboard should offer. My son has the ""Razer BlackWidow V3 Pro"" as his daily keyboard, I drive my ""ROCCAT Vulcan 120 AIMO"" as my main keyboard.",
Josh,1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't Work For Me,"The overall design and materials were not an issue for me, but every time I tried connecting it to my laptop (Chromebook) the mouse pointer would freeze in place on the screen and the mouse itself would stop responding (not even able to cycle through backlight colors). I tried this a few times by connecting to different USB ports and had the same issue each time. Ended up returning this one.",
Ryann,3.0 out of 5 stars,Tilts slightly on hard surface. Constantly changing colors. Good for money.,Probably just me not reading close enough but the colors change constantly. You can not select one color and have it stay there. At first it was distracting for me but I got used to it after a few days. Mine slightly tilts when I click the left button but not at all noticeable when using a mousepad.  Also has plastic on the bottom so take that off for a smoother feel.,
Tina M,1.0 out of 5 stars,This has got to be the worst mouse I've ever used,"Let me tell you what's good about the mouse first.  It's a great length, it's comfortable to use, it's lightweight, it's inexpensive, and it does not feel cheap at all.",
KATHY FRAGEMAN,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE IT,DID NOT REALIZE IT WAS A GAMING MOUSE.  BUT I LOVE IT & I BOUGHT IT FOR THE LONG CORD AS I AM 82 YRS OLD AND KEEP DROPPING THINGS.  I CAN PUT IT UP EASILY,
Tammy,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son loves this light up mouse,My son uses this mouse every day. Holding up well. He loves that it lights up,
Qtqbana ,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son was very pleased!,"This was bought for my son, so all the feedback is from his experiences. He asked for one with some feature buttons but not too many. He wanted it corded. He liked ones with alternating lights like his keyboard. He rated the accuracy at a 5/5 and comfort at 4/5. We arrived at the value for money together. 5/5.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than expected!,Got this for work.,
Gary M. Carpenter,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great gaming mouse for the money.,"A good little gaming mouse.  A tad smaller than my gaming Logitech mouse I had for years that fit my hand a little better,  but overall, it is comfortable and accurate.  Can't beat it for the price.",
Luthien,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it.,"It changes colors automatically, kind of annoying sometimes.",

Psychic Cypher,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice keyboard with some issues,I love this keyboard.,
J. Campbell,4.0 out of 5 stars,A very nice gaming keyboard, Pros:,
Bezoar,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Satisfying, noisy, tactile feedback.",Disclaimer: I received this product for free through the Vine program.,
Technology Guy,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice clacky keyboard,I'm using this mostly for writing and coding. I really like the feel of the keys and they have improved my typing accuracy.,
RW,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great and excellent value,"My son has 5 Mechanical keyboards as he loves them and was curious to compare this to the others that are in this price range and some more expensive such as the Ducky One 2 Mini.  He loves to change out the keys, see the colors and decide from several which ones he likes best.  He found this to be an excellent value.  It is full-sized, which if you need is not as common in gaming keyboards.  He switched out the key caps and found that easy to do.  The ""Clickiness"" he found to be addictive and enjoyed it almost as much as keyboards twice this price.",
Steve Taylor,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Budget Mechanical Keyboard,PROS:,
Sharkattack99,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good keyboard,Nice keyboard even made with metal parts which is a nice touch.,
Benji,2.0 out of 5 stars,Meh,"So first off, fully understand you get what you pay for. To potential buyers, spend the extra on a Red Dragon or something. This is very tingy after heavy use (work from home office, constant typing) and the space bar has started to stick due to one of the stabilizers being temperamental.",
S R,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good blue keys keyboard that I love,"If you don’t like full tactile feel, or a clicking sound is a distraction to you and/or others, this keyboard is not for you.",
AE Gross,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice click feel and great colors,"This keyboard has a great feel and click to it and there is no problem with ghosting problems.  Games play nice and smooth. It has a nice click without be overly loud.  The keys are a blue equivalent  ""clicky"" (clicky = a bump in the middle of travel accompanied by a sharp “click” sound.) The colors are quite nice and fade just for a second when you press them - pretty cool. The volume control works smoothly and also looks pretty cool. I have been using this for a number of weeks and it's still working great.  Very happy with this keyboard.",
Dino,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works perfectly so far.,Value for money.,
8675309,1.0 out of 5 stars,Settings change,Every bootup the mouse forgets the dpi setting and resets. Movement is tight and drags more than slides across the mouse pad.,
Francheska F.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Mouse,"very good mouse, it is very comfortable and I am really surprised with the quality with respect to the price, I also really like the cable, very good purchase.",
Br,3.0 out of 5 stars,Okay,It works as a temporary mouse untill u can get a really good one,
Isaiah,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not best for people with large hands.,Good value for money imo just little small for me personally.,
Weston,1.0 out of 5 stars,Glitchy and Unresponsive,"Do not buy this mouse... For a few dollars more, there are many options out there that actually work. Liked the physical mouse, but it was insanity inducing that it constantly froze or was glitchy. I hadnt been so annoyed since dial up internet. First one was garbage. Second one worked for a few days, then started doing the same thing. Spent an hour trying all windows 10 troubleshoots for mouse issues. Not software, drivers, settings, etc. Just trash.  Almost gave another star for return and refund, which i appreciated, but i didnt want anyone to get stuck in the same situation as me by confusing it to be a 2 star item. You have been warned! lol",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good purchase.,It is for my son. He loves the shape of it and he loves the color changing lights around the mouse.,
C. Simmons,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sleek and Smooth...,"I love this mouse. It is sleek and soft to touch, and moves smoothly. Great item for the price point.",
Brent Varner,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good mouse,Very good,
diana gail hardy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great acton mobility,Best gaming mouse I've ever had!,
GardenCat,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's loud, but I love how easy and precise it is.  It's great for writers too",This is definitely a clicky click keyboard.  It's keys are easier to push than my old IBM and it's louder.,
Sam Garcia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mechanical Keyboard - Nice to have,"I just plug in the mechanical keyboards and it just working perfectly. Very simple to use. It is very responsive when I type, click and press. When you click the ""FIODIO"" on the top right corner, you can switch the color setting. The only thing I want to get improve is the color on each key was stick to the same color that I can not change as it was build in the background.",
VisualSol,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great keyboard,I've used with both mac and PC.  No issues.  Keys are brightly lit.  Pleasant typing experience.  Good price.  Would definitely recommend.,
WSW,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for me.,I like the click feel of the keys.  The color leds under the keys makes looking at the occasional pad easy in the dark.  You can control a couple different functions with the roller bar.  I like that the lights can go to sleep with your computer.,
TastyPC,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cool keyboard for the price!,"Overall, it's a great deal for $35. The keys don't change color, but it has some cool patterns.",
tysonwalker jr,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far the best one that I have purchased,"Great keyboard so far, I will update in time it breaks",
Ken,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Keyboard,I actually use the keyboard at work for everyday computer use.  Every one of my computers both at home or in the office have these keyboards.  Great feel when typing.,
Joann,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great keyboard at a Great a price!,My kids love it and says it works great!,
L. Catt,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the lighted keyboard,"Didn't buy this for gaming, but love the lights on it.  My keyboard is on a slide out tray under my desk and it's usually dark there.  I bought this so I would know what keys I am using.  Was tired of looking for the backspace, tab Delete, and print screen buttons.  This solved the problem beautifully.  Be aware that certain keys are a certain color and this can't be changed unless you pull a key and change the light.  This is something I don't care about, because I don't care about the colors.  It does flash a lot if you want it to.",
R Stut,3.0 out of 5 stars,Basic affordable keyboard,"A bit lacking in features, but keys lit well and feel good and responsive when pressed.  Ordered two of them, one arrived in good condition, the other smashed at one end.  After fishing out the pieces and reassembling it I bent the metal face back in to position, but it never went back together right because some of the screw bosses on the plastic foundation were destroyed.  In spite of this the keyboard continues to function.",
Mariana,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,Very nice mouse. Works great and is comfortable. Love the colors as well. All buttons work great.,
Tara Evans,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great performing,It is a very nice mouse it performs great and is good for any computer,
Ander Examine,2.0 out of 5 stars,Meh,It’s an okay mouse. It’s weight in hand is overly light and so it’s not the best gamer mouse. The light gimmick is fine if you bought it for the shine but if you wanted function maybe search elsewhere.,
jesse valdivia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the mouse!,Awesome mouse for the price! Works great. HAPPY! :),
N Montour,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not great,I have big hands and this kept getting recommended. It is a longer mouse but it is way to flat to be any good. I quickly returned it.,
Vanessa S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cool lights and sleek design,Like the backlights so cool. Good value!,
Hasan Mohammed,1.0 out of 5 stars,garbage responsivity,the mouse cant even track your movements properly. you can see the delay on your monitor while moving your mouse. this is a mass produced chinese export with the buzzword gamer slapped on top of it.,
Victor Stott Jr.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Extremely Cheaply-Made,"Don't buy this mouse. It started freezing up after about a week of using it. It keeps stopping and skipping as I move the mouse across the screen, and it takes a few tries for it to recognize clicks and scrolls on the scroll wheel. The old saying is true - you get what you pay for. Save your money and get something else instead.",
Mr. Rusty,1.0 out of 5 stars,Design flaw needs to be corrected.,The mouse is a good mouse. It has all the right buttons in all the right places. It is the perfect shape for my hand.,
Hemet user,1.0 out of 5 stars,hard to use,Its got this button the side that puts you back a screen that would be nice but to move the mouse a person has to push there and it makes for a lot of accidental backing,
Charlie,1.0 out of 5 stars,Feels cheap,I guess you get what you pay for. The mouse works well enough but feels cheap and poorly made. The side buttons especially feel like they can break at any moment.,
Mathew A. Shember,4.0 out of 5 stars,A simple inexpensive gaming mouse.,"I admit I got this out of curiosity.  A layoff, covid lockdowns, and lost in a reshuffle.  I eventually found it again and gave it a try.",
C. Woodward,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice little mouse with a couple of annoying issues, Pros:,
Dustin Farahnak,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Dead simple, easy to use mouse","Compared to my nicest mouse, costing five times as much money, this mouse is actually better in a few ways.",
TOPJOB7,3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent value gaming mouse,This is a basic gaming mouse adequate for most purposes. It has added weight which many gamers prefer (non-removable in this case) and I find it just slightly heavier than I'm used to but it's in the typical range. It has a rubberized type coating on the top but it isn't grabby. The sides are ribbed hard plastic. It is average size with a contoured shape that feels very comfortable in my hand. The cord is about 4 feet long and has a nice braided cover.,
Tonja Drecker,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well,"Frustrated with a wireless mouse and the regular change of batteries, I decided to give this one a go. I'll admit, I'm not a gamer but do spend (thanks to work) a lot of time on the computer and wanted something easy to use, well fitting to the hand, and a little bit of fun. This mouse meets all of the above.",
l2,4.0 out of 5 stars,"smaller and lighter than most gaming mice, not programmable","This mouse is a little smaller and lighter weight than most gaming mice. It installed plug-and-play on my Windows 10 PC. It operates mostly smoothly and the DPI can be configured via buttons on the mouse. None of the buttons can be programmed like you can with name brand gaming mice. The lighting is cute at first, but gets annoying after a while. You can turn it off by pressing the two DPI buttons down at the same time. 3 stars for functionality + 1 star for value price = 4 stars.",
Persnickety,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Outstanding Value, Nice Wheel, Easy DPI switching","This is comparable to my razor mouse, not quite as good, but still very good. Especially given the very reasonable price.  I especially like the mouse wheel which is smooth and has good ""dpi"". (most mice in this range have a wheel where one click difference scrolls half a page)",
CocoLoco,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent mouse for the money,"This computer mouse if really great for the price.  It looks and feels like similar computer mice that cost twice as much.  The lighting is very basic, it just fades in a continuous cycle but the lights look pretty cool even if they aren't super customizable.  Fast and accurate,  decent build quality.",
Daniel Stark,4.0 out of 5 stars,⭐A great entry level mouse⭐ 👇👇👇,This FIODIO gaming mouse definitely has customer niche to cater.,
Auntie Annie,4.0 out of 5 stars,A  little trouble,"I'm still having a little trouble adjusting to this. I will say that it is easier on the hands than the regular mouse, but my brain seems to have been wired by repetition. Of course, I guess that would be true for any mouse where the clicker is located on the side. No reflection on the quality of this product.",
Alina,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well and I love the Colors,"For my use, this mouse works great! I should note that I am using this mouse for regular office use, not for gaming. I haven't had any issues with it so far. I have been using it every day while I work. I use it with my laptop so that I don't have to use the built-in touchpad. The scrolling wheel is convenient to use and the buttons react quickly when I press them. I especially like the rainbow colors, it brightens up my day!",
Kate Estevez,4.0 out of 5 stars,As good as my last one,"It’s very comfortable, the cable length is really good, the dpi is good and responsive. It looks nice and gets the job done. I’m happy with it. It works great for my level of gaming.",
Meka270,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice,Very nice mouse,
Elliot Knapp,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great mouse,"I like this mouse a lot--while I'm not a huge gamer, I often do music production work that requires a good, ergonomic mouse, and I enjoy having a mouse set up with a variety of secondary button functions.  The mouse feels nice and solid (it doesn't have a lot of sharp edges, which some gaming mouses do and I'm not a fan of), the scroll wheel is smooth, I like the braided cloth cord, and the pulsing LEDs are cool (although I wish they had a better sleep mode or something, since it continues pulsing even when the mouse hasn't been in use for a while).  If you don't mind a wired mouse, this is a cost-effective and good option!",
Gilbert M. Stack,5.0 out of 5 stars,Functional and Cool in One Package,"This is a very cool gaming mouse. First off, its basic function of moving the pointer around was smooth and accurate—no problems at all. In addition, the buttons on the side of the mouse greatly sped up moving forward and backward through page links. But it’s the ability to change the color of the light radiating from the mouse that is my favorite part of the instrument. I realize that the light color has nothing to do with the actual functionality, but it was just cool and I love it.",
Douglas C. Meeks,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Great Gaming Mouse,"This has it all, comfort for hours of play, responsive so no lag when it counts the most and add in plug and play (many gaming mice require additional software) plus looking really cool and you have a 5 Star device.",
Kim S,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fits well for both people of the house, 1 female, 1 male","The fiodio F-9520 Gaming Mouse has a nice slim ergonomic feel that's easy to use with a clean and elegant design. The matte black finish also shows oils after some use, but it's only visible when looking closely.",
B Frazier,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cool... comfortable mouse,"I always get the wireless mouse and having to keep replacing the battery in them, so this time I decided to try a wired one. I’m so glad I did. This mouse is so vibrant and colorful when in use. It’s very comfortable and it’s cars is long enough to reach from the back of my pc to the top of my desk and have wiggle room. It’s a gaming mouse and it does move with all the action. Great price and quality.",
Chris F.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good mouse for the price,"While I have not yet used this mouse for heavy gaming, light use has shown it to be very responsive and comfortable in my hand. The buttons respond well and the wheel spins as expected. I have been very happy with this thus far.",
Nuk,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not so precise,"I needed a quick replacement mouse because one of the buttons of the one I am using gave up.  If you are used to a nice more expensive mouse, the initial feel is that it is very basic and cheap.  My main problem is precision.  It should be OK as a multi-purpose mouse but felt underwhelming if you can call it a gaming mouse.",
Ernesto,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is still lasting,"The FIODIO Wired Gaming Mouse works very well for my laptop and haven't had any disconnecting issues of any kind. It feels comfortable when moving it around and clicking on items. I do not do have gaming, but it works well with the digital board games and playing Among Us. It is a good gaming mouse for the price.",
Troy Betenson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value,Easy to use and fits the hand great. Plug and play. Quick sensitivity adjustments on the top and back and forward browser buttons on the thumb side. Smooth roller button as well. Great value,
